# Bootstrap 3/4 Date/Time Picker with clock-like Time-Picker

This date-picker project is a fork of the famous [Eonasdan datetimepicker](https://github.com/Eonasdan/bootstrap-datetimepicker). A clock-like time-picker has been introduced into it and the widget is optimized to make it compatible to both Bootstrap 3 and 4 versions.
